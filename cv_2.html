        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>In 2003 I enrolled in a BA in Animation in IADT. For year afterwards I worked as an illustration, graphic designer and animator on various projects. 
In 2014 I undertook a Java programming course with the ETB. It involved designing, creating and testing software components using Java and upon completion of this course I was awarded a City & Guilds diploma in Java programming. </p>

        <p>I was later enrolled in a web development course with the ETB. As part of the course we took industry level exams and were awarded professional qualifications in, Oracle certified MySQL developer, Zend certified PHP engineer and Adobe certified Dreamweaver associate. </p>

        <p>In 2017 I made the decision to pursue this path further and returned to Cork and enrolled in UCC</p>
        <p>In September I began studying in the Business Information Systems programme at UCC. My dog came in tow and she is a big fan of the campus</p>
        <p>I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead as part of my continued education</p>

        <!--<h2>More Sports</h2>
        <p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of information about what to see while in San Francisco. The <a href="http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/">San Francisco Visitor Information Center</a> is the official travel and visitors&rsquo; guide to the city, with information in 14 languages.</p>
        <p>Among the many unofficial sites, the <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/san-francisco">Lonely Planet guide to San Francisco</a> is packed with useful information.</p>
        <h2>Sports Again</h2>
        <p>One way to see the city is on<a href="http://www.bigbustours.com/eng/sanfrancisco/custompage.aspx"> an open-top bus</a>, a hop-on, hop-off service that offers either prerecorded or live commentary. The route goes over the Golden Gate Bridge, giving stunning views across the city (as long as it&rsquo;s not shrouded in fog!)</p>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re feeling more energetic, several companies offer bicycle rental. You can even cycle across the Golden Gate Bridge on the wide bike path.</p>
        <p>And for something completely different&hellip; Why not <a href="http://www.electrictourcompany.com/">see the city on a Segway</a>?</p>-->
