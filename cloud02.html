        <h2>About Cloud Services</h2>
        <p>My company, Scrufftech is at the bleeding edge of Cloud computing and is best positioned to offer customers a range of Cloud based services. What is Cloud Computing, you ask?</p> 
        <p>Cloud Computing is a process of delivering/enabling scalable, expandable and almost perfectly elastic software services using internet technologies.</p> 
        <p>It is a method of delivering Software as a Service (SaaS), delivered in a pay-per-use basis. 
        It provides self service capabilities to users with scalable features to increase usage on requirement.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Software As A Service</h3>
        <p>Software as a Service (SaaS): It allows people to access the functionality of a particular software without worrying about storage or other issues eg.Salesforce.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Platform As A Service</h3>
        <p>(PaaS)Companies can run their applications on the cloud service’s platform without having to worry about maintaining hard drives and servers eg.Cloud9.</p>
        
        <h3>Infrastructure As A Service</h3>
        <p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Organizations make use of the unlimited storage potential of the cloud infrastructure. They can expand and shrink their storage space as needed without having to worry about dedicated servers on site. eg.Amazon.</p>
        
        <h3>Communication As A Service</h3>
        <p>Communications as a service (CaaS) is a collection of different vendor services that facilitate business communications. Organizations may use these and similar services to lower costs and increase efficiency for business processes involving audio or video telecommunications. eg.Gmail.</p>
        
        <!--Grab a <a href="http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfares/passports.htm">Muni Passport</a>, and ride the buses, streetcars, Metro, and—of course—the historic cable cars.</p>
        <!--<figure class="floatright"><img src="img/cable_car2.jpg" width="400" height="266"  alt=""/>
            <figcaption>The  front seat of a cable car affords a great view of the city</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>One of the best ways to get familiar with the city is to ride the Powell-Mason or Powell-Hyde cable car from Market Street. This takes you through Union Square, up over Nob Hill, through Chinatown, down to the waterfront at Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf. Stop off at Chinatown to soak in the unique atmosphere of the <a href="http://www.sanfranciscochinatown.com/">largest Chinatown outside Asia</a>. And if Chinese food sets your mouth watering, there are nearly 200 authentic Chinese restaurants to choose from.</p>
        <p>If you prefer seafood, then you&rsquo;ll love <a href="http://www.fishermanswharf.org/">Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf</a>. Even if you&rsquo;re not hungry, just stroll around the waterfront looking at the fishing boats and watching sea lions basking in the sun. Out in the Bay lies Alcatraz (the Rock), once home to notorious criminals, including Al Capone.</p>
        <figure class="floatleft"><img src="img/alcatraz.jpg" width="400" height="266"  alt=""/>
            <figcaption>Alcatraz—former exclusive residence for notorious criminals</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>To visit Alcatraz, it&rsquo;s advisable to <a href="http://www.alcatrazcruises.com/index.aspx">book the ferry tickets online</a> because they usually sell out about a week in advance. You&rsquo;re left free to wander around the Rock and the former federal prison. Budget about two and a half hours for the trip, and be prepared for changeable weather.</p>
        <p>If you can't get tickets for Alcatraz, take one of the many boat trips around San Francisco Bay. They take you around the Rock and out to the Golden Gate Bridge, another iconic symbol of the city.</p>
        <p>Just a few ideas to get you started exploring this fascinating city.</p>-->

        <h2>Other Stuff</h2>
        <p>One way to see the city is on<a href="http://www.bigbustours.com/eng/sanfrancisco/custompage.aspx"> an open-top bus</a>, a hop-on, hop-off service that offers either prerecorded or live commentary. The route goes over the Golden Gate Bridge, giving stunning views across the city (as long as it&rsquo;s not shrouded in fog!)</p>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re feeling more energetic, several companies offer bicycle rental. You can even cycle across the Golden Gate Bridge on the wide bike path.</p>
        <p>And for something completely different&hellip; Why not <a href="http://www.electrictourcompany.com/">see the city on a Segway</a>?</p>-->
